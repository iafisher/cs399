My senior thesis will review abstract interpretation as it is applied to programs that use faceted execution. Faceted execution is a programming-language mechanism that encloses sensitive data in facets, which consist of a policy, a real value, and a default value. To access the value of a facet, the observer must be checked against the facet's policy. If they do not satisfy the policy, they can access only the default value of the facet, leaving the real value secure against unintended observers. Faceted execution is designed to facilitate the enforcement of privacy policies so that they can be expressed separately from the implementation of the program, meaning that changes to the privacy policy can be made reliably with minimal modification of the application logic.

Abstract interpretation is a technique used to statically analyze programs. In the case of faceted execution, it is used to optimize the use of faceted values, which may carry substantial runtime overhead. For instance, to prevent information leakage a function applied to a faceted value must be executed twice, once for the real value of the facet and another time for the default value, so that the return value of the function is also a facet. If the static analyzer can prove that a facet passed to a function is only ever evaluated to its real value, then the function need only be evaluated with the real value of the facet, and significant performance gains could be realized.

Faceted execution has been implemented in a variant of Racket called \textsc{Racets} \cite{racets}. An abstract interpretation of a closely related language with faceted execution is also available \cite{abstract-inter}. My research will involve writing several substantial example programs that use faceted execution. Once I have written these programs in \textsc{Racets}, I will translate them into the language of the abstract interpreter, and assess what conclusions it is able to draw about them, and to what level of precision.
